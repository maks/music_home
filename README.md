My thanks to Pawan Kumar as this is basically his [Flutter-Music-Player app](https://github.com/iampawan/Flutter-Music-Player) with customisations and fixes to work on older, smaller screen Android phones and additional functionality to be a home app, to use in turning a Android phone into a basic DAP (digital audio player), minus the high-end audio hardware of course.
