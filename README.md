# music_home

A simple Android music player in Flutter.

## Features

* nice fullscreen music player UI
* uses the devices system MediaStore for list of music files
* works on device screens as small as 480x320
* is a "home" or "launcher" app, so can be made to be default launcher
* disables the screenlock (aka keyguard) if the devices screenlock setting is *not* pin or password

My thanks to Pawan Kumar as this is basically his [Flutter-Music-Player app](https://github.com/iampawan/Flutter-Music-Player) with customisations and fixes to work on older, smaller screen Android phones and additional functionality to be a home app, to use in turning a Android phone into a basic DAP (digital audio player), minus the high-end audio hardware of course.
